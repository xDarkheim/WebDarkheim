## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION

### Database Schema
The ticket system uses the existing database structure:
```sql
-- Existing tickets table from create_tickets_system.sql
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('open', 'in_progress', 'waiting_client', 'resolved', 'closed') DEFAULT 'open',
    priority ENUM('low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent') DEFAULT 'medium',
    category VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'general',
    assigned_to INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### Security Implementation
- **ClientAreaMiddleware**: Ensures only authenticated clients can access
- **Resource Ownership**: Clients can only view their own tickets
- **Input Validation**: All forms include server and client-side validation
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected with CSRF tokens
