## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS

### Unified Architecture
All pages follow a single pattern:

```php
// Bootstrap connection
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../includes/bootstrap.php';

// Global services
global $database_handler, $flashMessageService, $container;

// ServiceProvider
$serviceProvider = ServiceProvider::getInstance($container);
$authService = $serviceProvider->getAuth();

// Security checks
if (!$authService->isAuthenticated()) { /* redirect */ }
if (!in_array($current_user_role, ['client', 'employee', 'admin'])) { /* access denied */ }
```

### Security
- **Authentication**: Checked via AuthenticationService
- **Authorization**: Client role or higher verification  
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only edit their own projects
- **Data Validation**: Server-side and client-side validation
- **CSRF Protection**: For all data-modifying forms

### UI/UX Principles
- **Bootstrap 5**: Consistent component styling
- **FontAwesome Icons**: Consistent usage
- **Breadcrumbs Navigation**: On all pages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile device support
- **AJAX Operations**: Without page reloads
- **Toast Notifications**: Immediate feedback

---

## 📡 API INTEGRATION

All pages are integrated with API endpoints:

### Portfolio API (`/page/api/portfolio/`)
- `create_project.php` - project creation with images
- `update_project.php` - project updates
- `delete_project.php` - deletion with file cleanup
- `submit_for_moderation.php` - submission for moderation
- `toggle_visibility.php` - toggle visibility

### Client API (`/page/api/client/`)
- `get_profile.php` - get profile data
- `get_projects.php` - get project list
- `profile_update.php` - profile updates
- `skills_update.php` - manage skills
- `social_links.php` - manage social media links
